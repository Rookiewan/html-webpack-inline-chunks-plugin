```

Add the plugin to your webpack config as follows:

  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new HtmlWebpackInlineChunksPlugin()
]  
```
The above configuration will actually do nothing due to the configuration defaults.

```javascript

  loading: './xxx/loading'
},

  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
		inlineChunks: ['loading']
	}),
  new HtmlWebpackInlineChunksPlugin()
]  
```

```javascript
entry: {
  layer: './xxx/layer'
  loading: './xxx/loading'
},
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
		inlineChunks: []
	}),
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
		inlineChunks: ['layer']
	}),
  new HtmlWebpackInlineChunksPlugin({
    chunks: ['loading']
  })
]  
```
